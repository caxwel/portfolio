# Max Turer's Personal Portfolio

The source code of my personal portfolio, hosted at [https://maxturer.herokuapp.com]

## Technologies

This portfolio was built using **ReactJS**, with 3D/camera elements rendered using the **Three.js** library. 
The styling is done using **Sass**/**CSS**.
The contact form is a **Node/ExpressJS** server using the **Nodemailer** library.
The many cute drawings and assets are originals by me! I use **Clip Studio Paint**, if you're interested in my art software preferences.
